## Inspiration

Electronic Drawer is a versatile software application designed for both storage and financial management purposes. The inspiration behind this innovative program came from a personal experience of my roommate and me. One day, we purchased a carton of milk without paying attention to its expiration date. A week later, we drank the milk and obviously, we started feeling unwell. It took us several days to figure out the cause of our discomfort, which prompted us to come up with the idea of creating a mini-program that would notify us of the expiration dates of our food items. With this in mind, we decided to incorporate this feature into our software engineering project. The result is the Electronic Drawer, a handy tool that not only helps keep track of not only food but also makeup, medicines, and other objects' expiration dates but also aids in managing finances related to their expenses.
